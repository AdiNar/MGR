The following code was used to run simulations for my master thesis in computer science.

# Run
First install dependencies (virtual environment recommended):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run main.py script. Python 3.8 is required.
`./main.py` will run script with default parameters.
Check `./main.py --help` for adjustments.
